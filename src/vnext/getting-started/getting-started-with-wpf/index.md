# Getting started with WPF

Welcome to the *Getting started* guide for Catel and WPF. In this guide, a very simple application will be created with the most commonly used aspects of Catel and WPF.

The application will manage family members and will display the families in separate views.

Note that this guide assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of XAML and WPF since this guide will not cover these basics

The source code for this example can be found at <https://github.com/Catel/Catel.GettingStarted.WPF>

Note that this guide will recommend code snippets that can be found [here](http://www.catelproject.com/downloads/general-files/). They are not required, just recommended to speed up creating Catel classes and properties.
