# ValidatableModelBase

The `ValidatableModelBase` class extends the `[ModelBase](./modelbase.md)` class with functionality to validate the model. The 
class implements the `IDataErrorInfo` interface so it is possible to validate the data object and check the 
errors. This way, no custom validation code needs to be written outside the data class.

@alert important
More documentation should be written in the future
