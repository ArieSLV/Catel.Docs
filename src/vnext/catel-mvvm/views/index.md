# Views

Views are what the user actually sees on the screen. The views communicate with the view models. The MVVM Framework that ships with Catel can be used on its own. However, the framework requires some conventions that you, as end-user of Catel, should not be worrying about. Therefore, Catel ships with both a UserControl and a Window that fully support the MVVM Framework. Those can both be used as base classes for all controls and windows developed in an application.
