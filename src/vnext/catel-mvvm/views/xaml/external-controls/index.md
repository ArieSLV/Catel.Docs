# Using external controls

Catel ships with default controls and the *DataWindow*. However, some people rather use controls and windows from Telerik, DevExpress or some other 3rd party controls. This is perfectly possible and it is pretty easy to let those external controls support MVVM in the "Catel way".

The logic can be implemented via the MVVM behaviors that ship with Catel. In fact, the *DataWindow* and *UserControl* of Catel also use these behaviors to implement their logic.
