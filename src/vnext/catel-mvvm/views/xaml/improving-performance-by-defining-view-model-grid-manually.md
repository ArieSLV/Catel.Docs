Catel wraps the content of each user control in a grid. This grid is the actual view model container as can be read in the [advanced documentation](UserControl_-_under_the_hood). This wrapper is very convenient, but does have (little) impact on the performance and visual state management. To prevent Catel to wrap the control for you, there are a few things you can do.

# Creating the grid manually

The easiest way is to create the grid manually. The default implementation of the *IViewModelWrapperService *checks if the direct child control is a grid and has a specific name *'\_\_catelInnerWrapper'.* To prevent Catel from creating the wrapper, simply specify the name on the root grid.

Note that Catel will override the *DataContext* binding of this grid to reflect the view model.

# Customizing the *IViewModelWrapperService*

Another way to prevent Catel from wrapping the grids is to implement the *IViewModelWrapperService* yourself.

Note that we recommend to create the grid manually since that is highly likely to have less side-effects
