# Designers

Lots of developers are using designers such as the built-in designer in Visual Studio 2010 or Expression Blend to design their xaml based applications. Although you should [use designers with lots of care](http://blog.catenalogic.com/post/2011/02/24/Why-you-shouldn%E2%80%99t-use-a-GUI-designer-in-WPF-and-Silverlight.aspx), we strive to fully support all designers.

This part of the documentation shows the several design-time features that Catel provides.
