# Advanced WPF example

This example shows advanced functionality such as MEF, Unity, Nested User Controls and MVVM behaviors.

The first groupbox at the left shows how to instantiate a Window both where the MVVM logic is implemented in the view base (*DataWindow*) and a behavior (*WindowBehavior*).

The second groupbox shows how to instantiate the *UserControl* both where the MVVM logic is implemented in the view base (*UserControl*) and a behavior (*UserControlBehavior*).

The third groupbox shows the usage of the *IPleaseWaitService* (both in determinate and indeterminate mode) using the ServiceLocator, MEF and Unity.
